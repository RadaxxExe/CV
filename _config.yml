        Creation of a mobile application within the CEPN (Centre d"expertise des programmes navals).
        The objective of this application was to allow boaters to navigate using a mobile application displaying the seabed, as well as to allow boaters to highlight hazards they encounter (logs/containers) so that other users of the application can find out about hazards near their boat.
